In a typical introductory programming module, such as CS1010 and its variants at NUS, students tend to write small programs (in the order of tens or hundreds of lines of code) to solve a programming homework problem, work alone on their code, and move on to solve the next problem once the homework is done.</p> <p>The first aim of CS2030/S is to change the students' mindset and to make them learn to write software that will continue to evolve as software requirements change and to write software that will be read and modified by other programmers (including their future selves).</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. Code for readability.\"</p> <p>John Woods.</p> <p>The second aim of CS2030/S is to level up the complexity of programs that the students write, from the order of hundreds of lines to thousands of lines.  CS2030/S bridges the students between writing toy programs to solve specific problems in CS1010 and writing larger real-world software in their later modules, such as CS2103 Software Engineering.</p> <p>A programming language is a medium in which programmers can express their intentions and construct software and thus is critical to supporting the aims above.  With the appropriate features and tools, one can tame the complexity of software, make the code written friendlier to other programmers, and easier to evolve.  The third aim of CS2030/S is thus to expand the students' minds on different ways one can construct software and the principles behind some of the programming language constructs.  In particular, CS2030/S focuses on objects, types, and functions, as three key constructs for building programmer-friendly software.  It covers both object-oriented and functional paradigms as two different approaches to constructing software, with a strong emphasis on type safety.</p> <p>The final aim of CS2030/S is to introduce students to programming language concepts and to bridge them from introductory programming to advanced modules such as programming language design and implementation.  Part of CS2030/S introduces students to the design decisions behind some of the constraints and the workings behind the programming language compilation and execution, giving them a glimpse inside the programming system that so far has been mostly treated as a black box in introductory modules.</p> <p>Priority</p> <p>When writing programs to solve problems, the general priority should be the following:</p> <ol> <li>Correctness: Can your program run and solve the problem correctly?</li> <li>Efficiency: Can your program solve the problem efficiently?</li> <li>Maintainability: Can your program be maintained and improved upon by multiple people?</li> </ol> <p>The priority in CS1010 is correctness.  CS2040/S teaches you about how to increase efficiency while CS2030/S focuses more on maintainability.  However, you should never sacrifice correctness.</p>"},{"location":"00-overview.html#the-choice-of-java","title":"The Choice of Java","text":"<p>We decided to use one programming language throughout the module.

Software engineering is a broad discipline on its own and deserves another module.  Rather, this module is about the programming principles and constructs on top of which programmers can design better software.  To motivate the importance of these principles and constructs and see how they can be used, we will inevitably cover some of the software engineering design principles, such as Liskov Substitution Principle (the L in SOLID), Tell-Don't-Ask, Composition over Inheritance, etc.  However, we will not comprehensively cover object-oriented design or software design in general (e.g., we will not cover S, O, I, and D in SOLID).</p> <p>Finally, CS2030/S is not a module that focuses on computational efficiency.  We have CS2040/S for that.  In CS2030/S, although reducing computational cost still plays a role, this is not the only cost that matters.  CS2030/S is also concerned with the human cost of debugging or maintaining software.  In striving for simpler software that is easier to maintain and extend, we may have to sacrifice computational efficiency.</p>"},{"location":"00-overview.html#taming-complexity-in-software-development","title":"Taming Complexity in Software Development","text":"<p>An underlying theme of CS2030/S is taming complexity in software development.  There are objective metrics with which one can measure the complexity of software, but here, we will loosely define complexity as anything that increases the likelihood of bugs in a program.</p> <p>Let's start by considering a simplified view of what a software program is.  One can view a software program as a collection of data variables and instructions on how to modify these variables.  A program is generally written to meet a given requirement: given one or more input variables, the program should perform the computation to produce the output variables, in a way that meets the requirement.  Often, the program stores information in the intermediate variables while performing the computation.</p> <p>As a student who has gone through an introductory programming module such as CS1010 and its variants, you should be familiar with the view above, and you should have some experience writing a program to solve a given computational problem.  The programs you have written for these introductory modules are mostly small \"toy\" programs \u2014 they consist of only a few hundred lines and tens of variables, at most.</p> <p>Software development in the real world, however, is far more complex than what you have experienced.  A software program rarely solves a well-defined computational problem only.  It often requires multiple components, such as user interface, data storage, and business rules, intricately interacting with each other to attain a set of functionalities.  </p> <p>As the requirement of the software becomes more complex, the number of variables that need to be kept track of increases; the logic of the computation the programmer needs to maintain the variables becomes more complicated.  Further, it is often that the variables are interdependent.  For instance, updating a variable might require updating another; how a variable should be updated might depend on another variable.  As the number of variables increases, so is the number of relationships between the variables that the programmer has to keep track of.  Failure to correctly maintain the variables and the relationship between them most likely will lead to bugs.</p> <p>Further, real-world software rarely remains static.  This property is again different from what you have experienced in your introductory programming module, where once the instructors release a programming assignment, they rarely go back and change the requirements.  In the real world, software evolves \u2014 new features are added, business rules change, and better algorithms are deployed.  The code needs to be updated accordingly \u2014 adding new variables and new computation; changing how variables are updated or are dependent on each other.  Updating the code of an already-complex software program to keep up with the requirement, if not managed properly, can lead to bugs.</p> <p>Real-world software is often the product of teamwork from multiple programmers, where the software development process is unlike what you have experienced in your introductory programming module, where you solve your homework individually.  When multiple programmers work together, the interdependency between the states needs to be communicated and handled properly and consistently across the programmers.  One programmer's modification to the code should not introduce bugs into another programmer's code.  </p> <p>Since software evolves, the notion of \"multiple programmers\" actually applies even to software developed by a single lone programmer across time.  Changing one's code should not introduce new bugs to other parts of the code that were written some time ago.  </p>"},{"location":"00-overview.html#strategies-to-tame-complexity","title":"Strategies to Tame Complexity","text":""},{"location":"00-overview.html#good-software-development-practices","title":"Good Software Development Practices","text":"<p>If you are taught properly in your introductory programming modules, you should already be familiar with good programming practices that help to tame the complexity and reduce the chances of bugs.

The parameters and the return values are the only communication gateways across the barrier.  </p> <p>The abstraction barrier is something that we will refer to repeatedly in CS2030/S as well.  We will see how we maintain this barrier not only in the context of functions but also variables and computations on these variables together, by encapsulating them as objects and hiding details from the client through access modifiers.

It, however, also reduces flexibility as the software evolves.  If the client wishes to modify the computation protected by the abstraction barrier, it will need the help of the implementer.  In CS2030/S, we will see two ways we can modify the computation behind the abstraction barrier, without changing the code behind the barrier.  </p> <p>First, we will introduce the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism, the other two core principles of object-oriented programming.  These object-oriented mechanisms allow programmers to easily extend or modify the behavior of existing code.  </p> <p>Second, we will introduce closure, an abstraction to computation and its environment, that we can pass into the functions behind the abstraction barrier to perform a computation.  The second idea, if carried to the extreme in terms of flexibility, leads to the concept of monad in the functional programming paradigm.

To prevent this, both the programming language system and the programmers, have to adhere to certain rules when extending or modifying the behavior of the existing code.  Java and many other typed languages have type systems \u2014 a set of rules that governs how variables, expressions, and functions interact with each other.  You will learn about subtyping and the Liskov Substitution Principle, two notions that are important to constraining how inheritance and polymorphism should be used to avoid bugs.</p> <p>A type system is also an important tool to reduce the complexity of software development.  Constraining the interactions among the variables, expressions, and functions, reduces the possible interdependence between these programming constructs.  Furthermore, any attempt by programmers to break the constraint can be caught automatically by the compiler.  By utilizing the type system properly, we can detect potential bugs before they manifest themselves.</p> <p>A reason CS2030/S chooses to use Java is due to its type system.  CS2030/S will introduce the concept of types, subtypes, compile-time vs. run-time types, variants of types, parameterized types, and type inferences, in the context of Java.

During the compilation, this is the only type that the compiler is aware of.  The compiler will check if the compile-time type matches when it parses the variables, expressions, values, and function calls, and throw an error if there is a type mismatch.  This type-checking step helps to catch errors in the code early.</p> <p>Types on Variable</p> <p>An important distinction between dynamic and static type is where the type gets attached to.  In static typing, the type is attached to the variable such that the variable can only store values of that particular type (or its subtype as you will see later).  In fact, in Java, the type that is attached to a variable is the declared type (i,e., the type written in the variable declaration also commonly known as compile-time type).</p> <p>On the other hand, in a dynamically typed language, the type is attached to the value.

For instance, catching an attempt at multiplying two strings.  One way to ensure type safety is to catch type errors during compile time rather than leaving it to runtime.</p> <p>On the other hand, a weakly typed (or loosely typed) programming language is more permissive in terms of typing checking.  C is an example of a static, weakly typed language.  In C, the following is possible:</p> <pre><code>int i;        // declare a variable of type int\ni = 4;        // ok because 4 is of type int\ni = (int)\"5\"; // you want to treat a string as an int? ok, as you wish!   \n</code></pre> <p>The last line forces the C compiler to treat the string (to be more precise, the address of the string) as an integer, through typecasting.</p> <p>In contrast, if we try the following in Java:</p> <pre><code>int i;        // declare a variable of type int\ni = 4;        // ok because 4 is of type int\ni = (int)\"5\"; // error\n</code></pre> <p>we will get the following compile-time error message:</p> <pre><code>|  incompatible types: java.lang.String cannot be converted to int\n</code></pre> <p>because the compiler enforces a stricter rule and allows typecasting only if it makes sense.

More specifically, <code>long</code> is 64-bit and <code>float</code> is only 32-bit.

You can immediately see that the subtype has fewer number of bits than the supertype.  Therefore, the supertype can have more possible values.

This abstraction allows programmers to group a set of instructions and give it a name.  The named set of instructions may take one or more variables as input parameters, and return zero or one values.</p> <p>Like all other abstractions, defining functions allows us to think at a higher conceptual level.  By composing functions at increasingly higher levels of abstraction, we can build programs with increasing levels of complexity.</p> <p>Functions help us deal with complexity in a few ways as you will see later.  For now, to understand the examples, we will first describe a basic element of a function.  Note that this cannot be compiled but needs to be run on Jshell.  Once we have introduced the concept of a class, our code can be compiled.</p> <p>Syntax</p> <p>The basic syntax of a function is as follows:</p> <pre><code>return_type function_name(param_type1 param1, param_type2 param2) {\n    : // function body\n}\n</code></pre> <p>To create a function, we have to specify the return type.  If there is no return type, then we need to use the type called <code>void</code><sup>1</sup>.  This is then followed by the function name.  We may have zero or more parameters for a function.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Functions allow programmers to compartmentalize computation and its effects.  We can isolate the complexity within its body: the intermediate variables exist only as local variables that have no effect outside of the function.  A function only interacts with the rest of the code through its parameters and return value, and so, reduces the dependencies between variables to these well-defined interactions.  Such compartmentalization reduces the complexity of code.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>int factorial(int n) {\n  if (n == 0) {\n    return 1;\n  } else {\n    return n * factorial(n - 1);\n  }\n}\ndouble e(int n) { // approximate e^n using Taylor series\n  double x = 1;\n  double res = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n    res = res + (x/factorial(i));\n    x = x * n;\n  }\n  return res;\n}\n// The n in factorial is different from the n in e.\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Functions allow programmers to hide how a task is performed.  The caller of the function only needs to worry about what the function does.  By hiding the details of how, we gain two weapons against code complexity.  First, we reduce the amount of information that we need to communicate among programmers.  A fellow programmer only needs to read the documentation to understand what the parameters are for, and what the return values are.  There is no need for a fellow programmer to know about the intermediate variables or the internal computation used to implement the functions.  Second, as the design and requirements evolve, the implementation of a function may change.  But, as long as the parameters and the return value of a function remain the same, the caller of the function does not have to update the code accordingly.  Reducing the need to change as the software evolves reduces the chances of introducing bugs accordingly.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>double sinc(double x) {\n  return Math.sin(x)/x;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We do not need to know how to implement <code>sin(x)</code>, only whether <code>x</code> is in degree or radian.</p> </li> <li> <p>Functions allow us to reduce repetition in our code through code reuse.  If we have the same computation that we need to perform repeatedly on different values, we can construct these computations as functions by replacing the values with parameters, and pass in the values as arguments to the function.  This approach reduces the amount of boiler-plate code and has two major benefits in reducing code complexity and bugs.  First, it makes the code more succinct, and therefore easier to read and understand.  Second, it reduces the number of places in our code that we need to modify as the software evolves, and therefore, decreases the chance of introducing new bugs.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {\n    : // implementation omitted\n}\nboolean isEquilateral(double x1, double y1,\n    double x2, double y2, double x3, double y3) {\n  return distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) == distance(x2, y2, x3, y3)\n      &amp;&amp; distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) == distance(x1, y1, x3, y3);\n}\n// Define distance once, use it 4 times!\n// If we make a mistake in the function distance, we just have to correct it in one place\n//   instead of 4 different places if we did not use the function.\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>Returning More Than One Return Value?</p> <p>To return more than one value, we need to use a data type that can store multiple values.

Commonly used examples are mathematical objects such as complex numbers, 2D data points, multi-dimensional vectors, circles, etc, or everyday objects such as a person, a product, etc.</p> <p>Defining composite data type allows programmers to abstract away and be separated from the concern of how a complex data type is represented.</p> <p>For instance, a circle on a 2D plane can be represented by the center (i.e., <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>) and its radius <code>r</code>, or it can be represented by the top left corner (i.e., <code>x</code>,<code>y</code>) and the width <code>w</code> of the bounding square.</p> <p>In C, we build a composite data type with <code>struct</code>.

However, we are not completely shielded from its representation, until we write a set of functions that operates on the <code>circle</code> composite type.

The implementation will be different if we have a different representation of <code>circle</code> (e.g., <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> may represent the center of the circle or the top left corner of the bounding square).  But once the set of functions that operates on and manipulates circles is available, we can use the circle type without worrying about the internal representation.  Of course, this assumes that we will only use the functions specifically written to work on circle type.</p> <p>Additionally, the example on <code>circle_overlap</code> highlights another advantage of having a composite data type.  To see the advantage, imagine that you do not have the data type <code>circle</code>.

In the case of the user, we have an associated verb that needs to be modeled as a method.</p> <p>When to Stop?</p> <p>In the discussion above, we put forward the possibility that <code>Airport</code> need not be a class.  So the question is, when should we stop modelling a noun as a class?  We may be too eager to model everything as a class, including the date to be stored as booking date.  There is also the opposite problem of too lazy to model.  For instance, we may lazily group user and booking together to form a class with 4 fields.</p> <p>There is no clear answer to this but as a general guide, you may want to ask the following questions.</p> <ul> <li>Is there multiple properties to be stored?<ul> <li>If so, then creating a class is good.</li> <li>In the case of airport, if there is only a single data, then we need not make a class.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Is there an action associated with the entity?<ul> <li>If so, then creating a class is good.</li> <li>In the case of user, although it only has a single property, it has an association action.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Is there a real world counterpart?<ul> <li>If so, model it based on the real world.</li> <li>In the case of user and booking, we have real world counterpart so we model them as separate classes.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Is there potential changes to the entity?<ul> <li>If so, then creating a class is good.</li> <li>For instance, if in the future we plan to store more information about an airport (e.g., the country it is located, etc), then having it as a class will minimize potential changes to other parts of the code (e.g., if we used <code>String</code> before, we now have to change all these <code>String</code> into <code>Airport</code>).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The guide above are not exhaustive.

Unlike widening type conversion, which is always allowed and always correct, a narrowing type conversion requires explicit typecasting and validation during run-time.

Since they can affect how existing code behaves, they can easily break existing code and introduce bugs.  Since the client may not have access to the existing code behind the abstraction barrier, it is often tricky to trace and debug.  Furthermore, the implementer would not appreciate it if their code was working perfectly until one day, someone overriding a method causes their code to fail, even without the implementer changing anything in their code.</p> <p>Ensuring this responsibility cannot be done by the compiler, unfortunately. It thus becomes a developer's responsibility to ensure that any inheritance with method overriding does not introduce bugs to existing code.  This brings us to the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), which says: \"Let \\(\\phi(x)\\) be a property provable about objects \\(x\\) of type \\(T\\). Then \\(\\phi(y)\\) should be true for objects \\(y\\) of type \\(S\\) where \\(S &lt;: T\\).\"</p> <p>This is consistent with the definition of subtyping, \\(S &lt;: T\\), but spelled out more formally.</p> <p>Let's consider the following example method, <code>Course::marksToGrade</code>, which takes in the marks of a student and returns the grade 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'F' as a <code>char</code>.  How <code>Course::marksToGrade</code> is implemented is not important.  Let's look at how it is used.</p> <pre><code>void displayGrade(Course c, double marks) {\n  char grade = c.marksToGrade(marks);\n  if (grade == 'A')) {\n    System.out.println(\"well done\");\n  else if (grade == 'B') {\n    System.out.println(\"good\");\n  else if (grade == 'C') {\n    System.out.println(\"ok\");\n  } else {\n    System.out.println(\"retake again\");\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now, suppose that one day, someone comes along and creates a new class <code>CSCUCourse</code> that inherits from <code>Course</code>, and overrides <code>marksToGrade</code> so that it now returns only 'S' and 'U'.  Since <code>CSCUCourse</code> is a subclass of <code>Course</code>, we can pass an instance to <code>displayGrade</code>:</p> <pre><code>displayGrade(new CSCUCourse(\"GEQ1000\"), 100);\n</code></pre> <p>and suddenly <code>displayGrade</code> is displaying <code>retake again</code> even if the student is scoring 100 marks.</p> <p>The example above shows that we are violating the LSP unintentionally. The object <code>m</code> has the following property: <code>m.marksToGrade</code> always returns something from the set { <code>'A'</code>, <code>'B'</code>, <code>'C'</code>, <code>'F'</code> }, that the method <code>displayGrade</code> depends on explicitly.  The subclass <code>CSCUCourse</code> violated that and made <code>m.marksToGrade</code> return <code>'S'</code> or <code>'U'</code>, sabotaging <code>displayGrade</code> and causing it to fail.</p> <p>LSP cannot be enforced by the compiler<sup>1</sup>.

When we write a method, we may want to introduce test cases to check that our method is working correctly. These test cases are designed based on the specification of our method and not its implementation details<sup>2</sup>. That is, we test based on the expected inputs and resultant outputs.</p> <p>Let's look at an example. We would like to model a restaurant booking system for a restaurant chain. Consider the following <code>Restaurant</code> class.  Every restaurant in the chain opens at 12 PM and closes at 10 PM, and has a singular method <code>canMakeReservation</code> which allows us to check if the restaurant is available for reservations at a certain <code>time</code>.  The requirement given is that the system must be able to process a reservation during its opening hours.</p> <pre><code>public class Restaurant {\n  public static final int OPENING_HOUR = 1200;\n  public static final int CLOSING_HOUR = 2200;\n\n  public boolean canMakeReservation(int time) {\n    if (time &lt;= CLOSING_HOUR &amp;&amp; time &gt;= OPENING_HOUR) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The method <code>canMakeReservation</code> returns <code>true</code> when the argument passed into <code>time</code> is between 12 PM and 10 PM. Let's think about how we would test this method.  Two important edge cases to test are to check if the method returns true for the stated restaurant opening and closing hours.</p> <pre><code>Restaurant r = new Restaurant();\nr.canMakeReservation(1200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n  : // test for other hours between 1200 - 2200\nr.canMakeReservation(2200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n</code></pre> <p>Note that these are simple <code>jshell</code> tests, in software engineering courses you will learn better ways to design and formalize these tests.</p> <p>We can now rephrase our LSP in terms of testing. A subclass should not break the expectations set by the superclass. If a class <code>B</code> is substitutable for a parent class <code>A</code> then it should be able to pass all test cases of the parent class <code>A</code>. If it does not, then it is not substitutable and the LSP is violated.</p> <p>Let's now consider two subclasses of <code>Restaurant</code>, <code>LunchRestaurant</code> and <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code>. Our <code>LunchRestaurant</code> does not take reservations during peak hours (12 to 2 pm).</p> <pre><code>public class LunchRestaurant extends Restaurant {\n  private final int peakHourStart = 1200;\n  private final int peakHourEnd = 1400;\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean canMakeReservation(int time) {\n    if (time &lt;= peakHourEnd &amp;&amp; time &gt;= peakHourStart) {\n      return false;\n    } else if (time &lt;= CLOSING_HOUR &amp;&amp; time &gt;= OPENING_HOUR) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>LunchRestaurant</code> does not take reservations during peak hours (i.e., 1200 to 1400). As <code>LunchRestaurant</code> \\(&lt;:\\) <code>Restaurant</code>, we can point our variable <code>r</code> to a new instance of <code>LunchRestaurant</code> and run the test cases of the parent class, as can be seen in the code below.</p> <pre><code>Restaurant r = new LunchRestaurant();\nr.canMakeReservation(1200) == true; // Is false, therefore test fails\n  : // test for other hours between 1200 - 2200\nr.canMakeReservation(2200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n</code></pre> <p>Whilst the second test passes, the first test does not since it falls within the peak lunch hour.  Therefore <code>LunchRestaurant</code> is not substitutable for <code>Restaurant</code> and the LSP is violated.  We have changed the expectation of the method in the child class.</p> <p>Let's suppose the restaurant chain starts to roll out an online reservation system for a subset of its restaurants.  These restaurants can take reservations at any time. We create a subclass <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code>, as follows:</p> <pre><code>public class DigitalReadyRestaurant extends Restaurant {\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean canMakeReservation(int time) {\n    return true;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Similarly, as <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code> \\(&lt;:\\) <code>Restaurant</code>, we can point our variable <code>r</code> to a new instance of <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code> and run the test cases of the parent class, as can be seen in the code below.</p> <pre><code>Restaurant r = new DigitalReadyRestaurant();\nr.canMakeReservation(1200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n  : // test for other hours between 1200 - 2200\nr.canMakeReservation(2200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n</code></pre> <p>Both test cases pass.  In fact, all test cases that pass for <code>Restaurant</code> would pass for <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code>.  Therefore <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code> is substitutable for <code>Restaurant</code>. Anywhere we can use an object of type <code>Restaurant</code>, we can use <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code> without breaking any previously written code.</p> <p>We can now rephrase our LSP in terms of testing. A subclass should not break the expectations set by the superclass. If a class <code>B</code> is substitutable for a parent class <code>A</code> then it should be able to pass all test cases of the parent class <code>A</code>. If it does not, then it is not substitutable and the LSP is violated.</p>"},{"location":"16-lsp.html#preventing-inheritance-and-method-overriding","title":"Preventing Inheritance and Method Overriding","text":"<p>Sometimes, it is useful for a developer to explicitly prevent a class from being inherited.

Thus, there is only one representation of the generic type in the generated code, representing all the instantiated generic types, regardless of the type arguments.  </p> <p>Part of the reason to do this is for compatibility with the older version of Java.  Java introduces generics only from version 5 onwards.  Prior to version 5, one has to use <code>Object</code> to implement classes that are general enough to work on multiple types, similar to what we did with <code>Pair</code> here:</p> Pair v0.1 with Object<pre><code>class Pair {\n  private Object first;\n  private Object second;\n\n  public Pair(Object first, Object second) {\n    this.first = first;\n    this.second = second;\n  }\n\n  public Object getFirst() {\n    return this.first;\n  }\n\n  public Object getSecond() {\n    return this.second;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The Java type erasure process transforms: Pair v0.2 with Generics<pre><code>class Pair&lt;S,T&gt; {\n  private S first;\n  private T second;\n\n  public Pair(S first, T second) {\n    this.first = first;\n    this.second = second;\n  }\n\n  public S getFirst() {\n    return this.first;\n  }\n\n  public T getSecond() {\n    return this.second;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>to the version above.  Note that each type parameter <code>S</code> and <code>T</code> are replaced with <code>Object</code>.  If the type parameter is bounded, it is replaced by the bounds instead (e.g., If <code>T extends GetAreable</code>, then <code>T</code> is replaced with <code>GetAreable</code>).</p> <p>Where a generic type is instantiated and used, the code <pre><code>Integer i = new Pair&lt;String,Integer&gt;(\"hello\", 4).getSecond();\n</code></pre></p> <p>is transformed into <pre><code>Integer i = (Integer) new Pair(\"hello\", 4).getSecond();\n</code></pre></p> <p>The generated code is similar to what we would write earlier, but this is generated by the compiler after type checking, it ensures that the casting will not lead to <code>ClassCastException</code> during run-time.</p> <p>Type erasures have several important implications.  We will explore some of them below, and a few others during recitation.  </p>"},{"location":"24-erasure.html#generics-and-arrays-cant-mix","title":"Generics and Arrays Can't Mix","text":"<p>Let's consider the hypothetical code below:</p> <pre><code>// create a new array of pairs\nPair&lt;String,Integer&gt;[] pairArray = new Pair&lt;String,Integer&gt;[2];\n\n// pass around the array of pairs as an array of object\nObject[] objArray = pairArray;\n\n// put a pair into the array -- no ArrayStoreException!\nobjArray[0] = new Pair&lt;Double,Boolean&gt;(3.14, true);\n</code></pre> <p>This is similar to what we have in Unit 21, where we showed we could get an <code>ArrayStoreException</code> due to Java arrays being covariant.

Instead, we return a new <code>Point</code> instance to prevent mutating the current instance, as follows:</p> <pre><code>final class Point {\n  private final double x;\n  private final double y;\n\n  public Point(double x, double y) {\n    this.x = x;\n    this.y = y;\n  }\n\n  public Point moveTo(double x, double y) {\n    return new Point(x, y);\n  }\n    :\n\n  @Override\n  public String toString() {\n    return \"(\" + this.x + \",\" + this.y + \")\";\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that, to avoid (likely malicious or ignorant) subclasses of <code>Point</code> overriding the methods to make it appears that the point has mutated, it is recommended that we declare immutable classes as <code>final</code> to disallow inheritance.</p> <p>Now, let's make <code>Circle</code> immutable:</p> <pre><code>final class Circle {\n  private final Point c;\n  private final double r;\n\n  public Circle (Point c, double r) {\n    this.c = c;\n    this.r = r;\n  }\n    :\n\n  public Circle moveTo(double x, double y) {\n    return new Circle(c.moveTo(x, y), r);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>With both <code>Point</code> and <code>Circle</code> immutable, we can be sure that once an instance is created, it remains unchanged (outside the abstraction barrier):</p> <pre><code>Point p = new Point(0, 0);\nCircle c1 = new Circle(p, 1);\nCircle c2 = new Circle(p, 4);\nc1.moveTo(1, 1); // c1 remains unchanged\n</code></pre> <p>To update the variable <code>c1</code>, we need to explicitly reassign it.</p> <pre><code>c1 = c1.moveTo(1, 1);\n</code></pre> <p>Now, <code>c1</code> moves to a new location, but <code>c2</code> remains unchanged.</p> <p>Compare our new immutable approach to the two approaches above. The first shares all the references and is bug-prone.  The second creates a new copy of the instance every time and is resource-intensive.  Our third approach, using immutable classes, allows us to share all the references until we need to modify the instance, in which case we make a copy.  Such a copy-on-write semantic allows us to avoid aliasing bugs without creating excessive copies of objects.</p> <p>Note that the <code>final</code> keyword prevents assigning new values to the field.

Then in every formula that \\(f(x)\\) appears in, we can safely replace occurances of \\(f(x)\\) with \\(a\\).  Conversely, everywhere \\(a\\) appears, we can replace it with \\(f(x)\\).  We can be guarantee that the resulting formulas are still equivalent.</p> <p>These two fundamental properties of mathematical functions allow us to solve equations, prove theorems, and reason about mathematical objects rigorously.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we can't always reason about our program the same way as we reason about mathematical functions.

Suppose we have a variable</p> <pre><code>T t = s.get(0);\n</code></pre> <p>Then everywhere in our code where we use <code>t</code>, we should be able to replace it with <code>s.get(0)</code>, and the behavior of the code should still be the same.

However, if we implement <code>findCounter</code> such that it returns <code>null</code> if no counter is available, then <code>findCounter</code> is not a function anymore.  The return value <code>null</code> is not a counter, as we cannot do things that we can normally do on counters to it.  So <code>findCounter</code> now maps to a value outside its codomain!  This violation of the purity of function adds complications to our code, as we now have to specifically filter out <code>null</code> value, and is a common source of bugs.</p> <p>One way to fix this is to have a special counter (say, <code>class NullCounter extends Counter</code>) that is returned whenever no counter is available.

CS2030/S prepares you to work in a software engineering team in many ways. One of the ways is to enforce a consistent coding style.</p> <p>If everyone on the team follows the same style, the intent of the programmer can become clear (e.g., is this a class or a field?), the code is more readable and less bug-prone (e.g., see the Apple <code>goto fail</code> bug for an example of buggy program due to style_).  Empirical studies support this:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\"It is not merely a matter of aesthetics that programs should be written in a particular style. Rather there is a psychological basis for writing programs in a conventional manner: programmers have strong expectations that other programmers will follow these discourse rules. If the rules are violated, then the utility afforded by the expectations that programmers have built up over time is effectively nullified. The results from the experiments with novice and advanced student programmers and with professional programmers described in this paper provide clear support for these claims.\"</p> <p>Elliot Soloway and Kate Ehrlich. \"Empirical studies of programming knowledge.\" IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 5 (1984): 595-609.</p> <p>Many major companies enforce coding styles, and some have published them.

We are going to build our own Java packages using these useful classes.</p>"},{"location":"exercises/ex5-task.html#java-package","title":"Java <code>package</code>","text":"<p>Java package mechanism allows us to group relevant classes and interfaces under a namespace. You have seen two packages so far: <code>java.util</code>, where we import <code>List</code>, <code>Arrays</code>, from, and <code>java.lang</code> where we import the <code>Math</code> class. These are provided by Java as standard libraries. We can also create our package and put the classes and interfaces into the same package. We (and the clients) can then import and use the classes and interfaces that we provide.</p> <p>Java package provides a higher layer of abstraction barrier.  We can designate a class to be used outside a package by prefixing the keyword <code>class</code> with the access modifier <code>public</code>.  We can further fine-tune which fields and methods are accessible from other classes in the same package using the <code>protected</code> access modifier.</p> <p>You can read more about java packages and the <code>protected</code> modifier yourself through Oracle's Java tutorial.</p> <p>We will create a package named <code>cs2030s.fp</code> to be used for Exercises 5-7.</p> <p>First, we need to add the line: <pre><code>package cs2030s.fp;\n</code></pre></p> <p>on top of every <code>.java</code> file that we would like to include in the package.</p> <p>Second, the package name is typically written in a hierarchical manner using the \".\" notation. The name also indicates the location of the <code>.java</code> files and the <code>.class</code> files. For this reason, you can no longer store the <code>.java</code> files under <code>ex5-username</code> directly. Instead, you should put them in a subdirectory called <code>cs2030s/fp</code> under <code>ex5-username</code>. To start, our <code>cs2030s.fp</code> package will contain the two interfaces <code>Transformer</code> and <code>BooleanCondition</code> that you have written in Exercise 4.</p> <p>Third, the classes or interfaces that you want to expose to others should be declared as a <code>public</code> class or interface.  You can do so by adding the keyword <code>public</code> when you declare the class or interface.

For instance, given <code>16189</code> and <code>Clementi</code>, the program will output</p> <pre><code>Search for: 16189  &lt;-&gt; Clementi:\nFrom 16189 \n- Can take 96A to:\n  - 17009 Clementi Int\n- Can take 96B to:\n  - 17171 Clementi Stn Exit A\n  - 17091 Aft Clementi Ave 1\n- Can take 96 to:\n  - 17171 Clementi Stn Exit A\n  - 17091 Aft Clementi Ave 1\n  - 17009 Clementi Int\n- Can take 151 to:\n  - 17091 Aft Clementi Ave 1\n\nTook 7,433ms\n</code></pre> <p>The pairs of <code>S</code> and <code>Q</code> can be either entered through the standard input or given to the program in a text file, with every pair of <code>S</code> and <code>Q</code> in a separate line.</p> <p>A program to query the bus API and given a query has been written.  Study the program carefully to understand what it does and how it works.</p> <p>The given program, however, is written synchronously.  Every query to the Web API is done one-by-one, and the program has to wait until one query completes before it can continue the execution of the program.  As a result, the program is slower than it should.</p> <p>Your task, for this lab, is to change the given program so that it executes asynchronously.  Doing so can significantly speed up the program.  </p> <p>The root of synchronous Web API access can be found in the method <code>httpGet</code> in <code>BusAPI.java</code>, in which the invocation of method send from the class HttpClient is done synchronously (i.e., it blocks until the response returns).    </p> <p><code>HttpClient</code> also provides an asynchronous version of <code>send</code> called sendAsync, which is the same as <code>send</code> excepts that it is asynchronous and returns a <code>CompletableFuture&lt;HttpResponse&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> instead of <code>HttpResponse&lt;T&gt;</code>.  (You do not need to get into the nitty-gritty details of the <code>HttpClient</code> and <code>HttpResponse</code> for this lab -- but they are good to know, read up about them at your leisure).</p> <p>To make the program asynchronous, you should first change the invocation of <code>send</code> in <code>BusAPI</code> to <code>sendAsync</code>.  All other changes will be triggered by this.  The list of things you should change are:</p> <ul> <li><code>BusAPI::getBusStopsServedBy</code> now returns a <code>CompletableFuture&lt;String&gt;</code></li> <li><code>BusAPI::getBusServicesAt</code> now returns a <code>CompletableFuture&lt;String&gt;</code></li> <li><code>BusStop::getBusServices</code> now returns a <code>CompletableFuture&lt;Set&lt;BusService&gt;&gt;</code></li> <li><code>BusService::getBusStops</code> now returns a <code>CompletableFuture&lt;Set&lt;BusStop&gt;&gt;</code></li> <li><code>BusService::findStopsWith</code> now returns a <code>CompletableFuture&lt;Set&lt;BusStop&gt;&gt;</code></li> <li><code>BusRoutes</code> now stores a <code>CompletableFuture&lt;Set&lt;BusStop&gt;&gt;</code> instead.</li> <li><code>BusRoutes::description</code> now returns a <code>CompletableFuture&lt;String&gt;</code> (hint: use <code>thenCombine</code>)</li> <li><code>BusSg::findBusServicesBetween</code> now returns a <code>CompletableFuture&lt;BusRoutes&gt;</code></li> </ul> <p>It is important that at no point in any of the code above, you call <code>CompletableFuture::join</code> (or <code>get</code>) on any of the <code>CompletableFuture</code>, so everything that has been done so far, from the lower-level Web API calls to the higher-level logic of searching for bus services, is done asynchronously.</p> <p>For this lab, the only place where you should <code>join</code> is in <code>main()</code>, where you now have multiple <code>CompletableFuture</code> objects, one from each call to <code>findBusServicesBetween</code>.  As the final step, you should change <code>main()</code> so that it waits for all the <code>CompletableFuture</code> objects to complete using <code>allOf</code> and <code>join</code>, followed by printing out the description of the bus routes found.</p> <p>The speed up your would experience for the asynchronous version depends on the complexity of the inputs.  For the following test input: <pre><code>8031 Orchard\n17009 NUS\n17009 MRT\n15131 Stn\n8031 Int\n12345 Dummy\n</code></pre> I reduced the time from around 120-180 seconds to 10-15 seconds, more than 10 times speedup.  Your mileage may vary, but you should see some speed up in the total query time.</p> <p>Your code should produce the exact same set of bus routes as the synchronous version, although it can be in a different order.</p> <pre><code>$ javac *java\n$ java Main &lt; test1.in\n$ java Main &lt; test2.in\n$ java -jar ~cs2030s/bin/checkstyle.jar -c ~cs2030s/bin/cs2030_checks.xml *.java\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"exercises/ex9-task.html#following-cs2030s-style-guide","title":"Following CS2030S Style Guide","text":"<p>You should make sure that your code follows the given Java style guide and the give Java documentation guide.</p>"},{"location":"micro/operations.html","title":"Micro HOWTO: Common Code Editing Operations","text":"<p>Work in Progress</p> <p>This article is a work-in-progress.</p>"},{"location":"micro/operations.html#micro-as-a-source-code-editor","title":"Micro as a Source Code Editor","text":"<p>A source code editor is more than a text editor.

For normal typing, your left hand is supposed to be placed over the keys A S D F, so you just need to move slightly your left pinky to Shift and left ring finger to Z and hit them.</p> </li> <li> <p>To move the cursor, instead of using the arrow keys, <code>vim</code> uses H to move left, L to move right, J to move down, and K to move up.  For normal typing, your right hand is supposed to be placed on J K L ;, so these arrow key alternatives are located very near to where your right hand should be!</p> </li> </ul> <p>I have a few more things to say about using H J K L to replace the arrow keys:</p> <ul> <li> <p>It is not uncommon for applications to re-map other keys for movement.  Many first-person shooting games use W A S D for movement, for the same reason as <code>vim</code> \u2014 it is close to the resting position of the left hand on the keyboard.</p> </li> <li> <p>The use of H J K L for movement is more ubiquitous than you think.  In the Web version of Gmail, Facebook, and Reddit, for instance, you could use J and K to move up and down across posts.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"vim/philosophy.html#multi-modal-editor","title":"Multi-modal Editor","text":"<p><code>vim</code> is a multi-modal editor.  While most other editors make no distinction between reading and editing, <code>vim</code> makes an explicit distinction between the two.  <code>vim</code> has two basic modes:</p> <ul> <li><code>NORMAL</code> mode: where you read, navigate and manipulate the text.</li> <li><code>INSERT</code> mode: where you insert the text</li> </ul> <p>As a programmer, having a separate <code>NORMAL</code> mode makes sense since we spend much time reading and navigating around source code.  Thus, allowing the editing commands to be optimized.</p> <p>In the <code>NORMAL</code> mode, you can use any of these keys I S A O (with or without Shift) to switch to <code>INSERT</code> mode.  To go back to <code>NORMAL</code> mode, press Esc.  The keys I S A O have different meanings, which you will learn later.</p> <p>Note that most of the time you will be in <code>NORMAL</code> mode.  So a habitual <code>vim</code> user would insert some text and immediately switch back to normal mode by hitting Esc.</p>"},{"location":"vim/philosophy.html#tell-vim-what-you-want-to-do-dont-do-it-yourself","title":"Tell <code>vim</code> What You Want To Do; Don't Do It Yourself","text":"<p>In <code>NORMAL</code> mode, you can manipulate text in <code>vim</code> by issuing commands to <code>vim</code>.  These commands are like a programming language.  It is also not unlike the Unix commands, in that each command does a small thing but can be composed together to perform complex text manipulation.</p> <p>Let me give an example here.  Suppose you have a sentence:</p> <pre><code>Wherever there is light, there is also a shadow.\n</code></pre> <p>You want to remove <code>also a</code> from the sentence.</p> <p>What would you do in a typical text editor?  You move your hand away from the keyboard, find your mouse, move your mouse cursor to highlight the text, and then hit Del.  Or you could move the cursor (by mouse or by repeatedly hitting the keyboard) to place the cursor after <code>a</code>, and then press Del six times.</p> <p>In addition to being tedious, this is error-prone.  You might highlight one additional or one less space, or hit Del one too many times.</p> <p>What we are used to doing is performing the action of deleting the words ourselves.  For <code>vim</code>, we do it differently.  We need to look for the word <code>also</code> and delete two words.  This translates to the command / A L S O Enter D 2 W.</p> <ul> <li>/ triggers a search.  This is an almost universal command \u2014 try / on Facebook (web) or on this page.</li> <li>A L S O Enter tells <code>vim</code> what you want to search. After pressing Enter, your cursor should be placed at the beginning of <code>also</code>.</li> <li>D 2 W tell <code>vim</code> to \"delete two words\".</li> </ul> <p>Instead of worrying about the actual actions to perform the deletion, we issue higher-level commands to describe what we want to do.  This is powerful since this is how our brain thinks \u2014 \"I need to insert this here, change this word to that, remove two lines, etc.\"  All these maps into commands in <code>vim</code>.  As a result, once you master <code>vim</code> basics, you can type as fast as you think<sup>1</sup>!</p> <p>A common pattern for <code>vim</code> command consists of three parts:</p> <ol> <li>Place the cursor.</li> <li>Perform an action.</li> <li>Move to the new placement of the cursor.</li> </ol> <p>In the example above, / A L S O Enter places the cursor, D is the action (delete), and 2 W is the movement (move the cursor forward by two words).</p> <p>Another common command that students use is G G = Shift+G.  This command is used to indent the source code in the current file.  G G is the command to place the cursor at the top of the file.  = is the action (indent), and Shift+G is the command to place the cursor on the last line of the file.</p>"},{"location":"vim/philosophy.html#be-a-good-unix-citizen","title":"Be A Good Unix Citizen","text":"<p>Not only do the basic commands <code>vim</code> adhere to the Unix principles of composability, <code>vim</code> plays well with Unix shells, which adds additional power to <code>vim</code>.
